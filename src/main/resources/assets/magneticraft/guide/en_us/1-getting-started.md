# Welcome to Magneticraft

**Disclaimer**
A lot of stuff is not finished or needs more work, 
the mod was tested and should be stable but some features, for example, images in the guide book are not done yet.

### First steps

Magneticraft add 3 types of ores: copper (Chalcopyrite), lead (Galena) and Tungsten (Wolframite), 
to process them there are the [crushing table](2.1-crushing-table.md) and the [sluice box](2.2-sluice-box.md).
Some recipes needs plates, to make them just put an ingot in the crushing table and smash it with a hammer.
